# Mocha

I'm a maintainer of [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), a JavaScript testing framework for Node.js and the browser. This folder will include several packages, one of them being the Mocha source code itself for my ease of reference. Others will be issue reproductions, examples, and other experiments.

All work with Mocha will use `npm`, not `pnpm`, because the Mocha source uses `npm`.

## packages

### mocha

The [Mocha source code](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)

When formatting the Mocha source code, run Prettier with `--no-config`. Ref [Mocha issue 5621](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/5621) for details.
