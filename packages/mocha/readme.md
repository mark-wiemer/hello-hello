# Mocha

I'm a maintainer of [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), a JavaScript testing framework for Node.js and the browser. This folder will include several packages, one of them being the Mocha source code itself for my ease of reference. Others will be issue reproductions, examples, and other experiments.

## packages

### mocha

## to-do

Prettier doesn't like monorepos, to say the least.
