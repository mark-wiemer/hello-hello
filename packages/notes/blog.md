### Politics

- We don't feel heard
  - This applies to so many of us
- This is not a partisan issue
  - Let's look at the facts, and make our decision from there
  - No, we won't know everything, but what do we know? What evidence do we have, beyond just claims?
- Hold them all accountable / lives lost forever
  - Yes, Renee Good is accountable for driving away, Pretti for bringing a gun, democrats for speaking the way they do
  - But also Republicans are accountable for starting this whole thing and then executing smear campaigns minutes after folks are dead
  - Also ICE prevented a physician from helping Renee, saying "I don't care," while Renee still had a pulse
  - One group is yelling, another group is shooting. Who's to blame when people die?
- Claims, evidence, and the truth
  - Poke holes, but on both sides
  - They don't need to cite chapter and verse, but they should show something
  - These people are in charge of hundreds of millions of lives, yes, we should hold them to an extremely high standard

#### Past precedent

- The '60s vs today
  - MLK Jr assassinated before Civil Rights Act was passed (1968)
  - 1967 Milwaukee Riot
  - 2016 Milwaukee riot
- Those who died during Civil Rights Movement
- March on Washington
- Kent State shootings
  - President blaming students
  - Deputizing inexperienced folks without good reason
  - Taking away rights
  - Shooting without provocation
  - Lying about it after the fact
    - Two ICE agents accused by their bosses of lying under oath in 2026
- Martin Luther King Jr

### Personal

- Fixing the algorithm
  - Just delete social media :)
- The Mac and cheese that saved my life

### Software

- I don't care what LLM you drive
- AI memory is a bad metaphor
  - It's more like talking to a different person every time, and the only info they have is the notes left for them by the last person

## My flaws

> In order to create the universe, one must first gracefully recognize one's shortcomings.

There's a lot of crap in the world. Motivational speakers try to glaze over that and remind you that you can be your best self if you just follow their quick tips and maybe buy their book or attend their talk or whatever. Beyond that, those speakers generally seem to focus on one particular thing that, while helpful to many, seems to apply a hidden point to only one domain instead of clarifying the broader point to help us see where we can apply it in our lives.

As I write this, I realize there are some good general-purpose books out there: Atomic Habits by James Clear and Mindset by Carol Dweck come to mind. We need more of those!
