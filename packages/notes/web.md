# Core web technologies

Primarily HTML and CSS. For JavaScript, see [Hello JavaScript](../javascript/readme.md).

## HTML

- Non-tag part of an element is called `content`

### Fun facts

- Closing slash in `br` isn't necessary!
- Tags aren't actually case-sensitive

## Resources

- [Structuring content with HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) and all the modules after it :)
