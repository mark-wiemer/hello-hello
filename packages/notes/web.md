# Core web technologies

Primarily HTML and CSS. For JavaScript, see [Hello JavaScript](../javascript/readme.md).

## HTML

- Non-tag part of an element is called `content`
- `strong`, `em`, and `mark` are preferred over `b`, `i`, and `u`, respectively
  - [Emphasis and importance - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Emphasis_and_importance)

### Fun facts

- Closing slash in `br` isn't necessary!
- Tags aren't actually case-sensitive

## Resources

- [Structuring content with HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) and all the modules after it :)
