# Hello Product

Recommendations I try to follow for all products I build, regardless of framework. Presented in alphabetical order:

- Accessibility
  - Full assessment every 90 days
    - Accessibility Insights assessment
  - All features thoroughly tested
    - One finger
    - Mouse-only
    - Keyboard-only
    - Eyes closed + screen reader
    - Sound disabled
  - See also usability
- Documentation
  - Markdown documents for everything
  - Ideally everything is in one `docs` folder except for `readme.md`
  - Comment liberally: it's easier to remove than it is to add later
- Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
  - Never creative
    - AI-generated images/video/audio is only used for demo/explanatory purposes
    - AI-generated text is never copy-pasted, always rewritten by me
      - Generally I only use GenAI with writing to correct typos
  - Always optional
    - Users should be able to easily navigate the site without using GenAI tools
    - See also usability
  - Always disclosed
    - Prominent "AI-generated content may be incorrect" or similar disclaimer near every message
  - Never tries to "be a person"
    - Never refers to itself as "I" or "we", instead says things like "this bot" or "this product"
    - Not open to general conversation, always focused on purpose-built tasks
  - Never trusted
    - All AI output is checked by handwritten procedures, e.g., making sure all links exist
    - Comprehensive e2e tests are in place and pass before any GenAI changes are deployed
  - Ethically trained
    - StarCoder LLM
- Performance
  - Test all pages with "Slow 3G" connection
  - Defer all images, but with Cumulative Layout Shift handled
  - Use low-res images first with optional high-res images based on connection speed, connection type?, user preferences
  - Prioritize sending minified content instead of sending inspectable content
    - Source code linked anyway, see "transparency" section
  - Only apply CSS rules where necessary (e.g. don't apply rules to all `figure` elements if only some need them)
  - Use stylesheets instead of repeated style attributes
- Privacy
  - No cookie banner: Only use strictly necessary cookies
  - Transparent tracking: If I do track info, it's always
    - Opt-in
    - Easy to opt out (max 4 clicks: menu > settings > telemetry > opt out)
    - Clear what data is being sent (sample JSON payload)
    - Clear what data will never be sent (IP, location, etc.)
    - Clear when the tracked data changes
      - Users are automatically opted out?
      - Subtle badge appears in settings submenu
      - Notification? (max 1 change per month if so? Notification spam sucks)
- Project management
  - Use the lightest tools that work
  - Use automation whenever reasonable
    - Re-evaluate bot configs on a regular basis
  - Infrastructure as code (e.g. GitHub REST API for new repos)
- Security
  - I only build static sites right now, so no special concerns here
- Testing
  - Automated tests for as much as possible
  - If automated tests are infeasible:
    - Detailed manual repro steps are available (GitHub Gist or commit)
    - Issue is opened for automating tests for that area
- Transparency
  - Source code linked to each project
  - Licensed under MIT or other widely-recognized FOSS license
- Tooling
  - When working with source code, spell-checker should be enabled
- Usability
  - Command palette should be available for all interactions with the site
    - All settings discoverable
    - All pages discoverable
    - Actions like "sign out", "sign in"
