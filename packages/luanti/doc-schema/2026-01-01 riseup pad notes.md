# Riseup pad notes

## Defining Markdown doc format

This section seems to define a detailed Markdown doc format:

```md
#### `node = core.get_node(pos)`

Returns the node at the given position.

- **args**
  - pos : {Vector} : position of the node on the map
- **return**
  - node : {MapNode} : name is "ignore" for unloaded chunks
- **env**
  - server-main
  - server-async
  - client
  - server-mapgen
```

I don't think we're at this point yet, I am focusing still on gathering expressiveness requirements. But this is good to have for later reference!
