# Hello Melvor

OK it's time to clean up all these weird UX issues with Melvor!

## Projects

### Cleanup

- Batch of mods organized by affected skill or view (bank, menu, settings, etc.)
- Organize the UX, removing noise and adding search when valuable
- Does not affect what players can do, but allows them to do it faster
  - Same number of clicks, but buttons are easier to find

### QoL

- Does affect what players can do
  - e.g. macro to harvest, apply goop, and replant with one click
