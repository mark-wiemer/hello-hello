Many of us make friends on social media. I know a number of people that spent months chatting with others online, eventually flying out to meet in-person, having a wonderful time, and growing even closer in their friendship. This is lovely! This is what social media should be, and it warms my heart to know that it's real.

This is not a problem, and not something that needs a solution. If you're meeting real people on social media, that's awesome. Stick with it, have fun, and I trust you to do your due diligence before buying any plane tickets!

The news we get from social media is curated algorithmically from a huge variety of mostly-unreliable sources. With the goal of keeping you locked in and looking at ads, engineers at Big Tech work to ensure their algorithm delivers the most engaging content possible. Not the most informative, the most relevant, or the most insightful: the most engaging. We already know that this means outrageous claims, literal fake news, and hateful posts that trigger our fight-or-flight response.

The alternative is subscribing to a traditional news service. Some are free, but the good ones do cost money. Fortunately, it's usually $5 a month or less, and it's well worth the price to stay informed and free from artificial algorithms.

A common argument against switching to mainstream media is simple: they're also corrupted by engagement farming. And to a degree, that's very true. But there are good sources out there. They're not even that hard to find! This is where watchdogs are valuable. ad fontes media publishes an interactive media bias chart, and after cross-referencing with AllSides and Biasly, I decided to subscribe to both the BBC and The Dispatch. I haven't regretted either decision. I haven't felt engagement-baited at all since I subscribed in early January, even during the chaos of the Minnesota DHS killings.

When we follow the money, we see that these ad-free, subscriber-funded sources (though the BBC is also funded by the UK government) are incentivized to keep you willing to pay. And who's willing to pay for low-quality engagement bait? Meanwhile, social media's money is entirely ads, and it has the opposite goal, and we already know the outcome.
