Hello, world! Welcome to my little corner of the internet :) I'm the human in the above photos.
The cute dog is Wynonna, my Australian shepherd 🥰

## A note on mistakes

2026-01-25: I created this site as a random guy who wanted to share his thoughts via a fast-loading, independent website. I also wanted to take this site as an opportunity to learn about new web frameworks. As such, this site is the first site I've ever built with a new framework I'm learning. Before this framework, all dates were manually updated. Many still are. As I begin to update this site more frequently, some "last updated" dates, and other minor things like site formatting, may be incorrect. I'm sorry about this and am working better automate these processes. In the meantime, please give me grace, and reach out on Medium if you have questions: you can comment on any of my recent articles requesting clarity on anything, even if it's unrelated to the article. To see my progress, you can look at the [Git commit history](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/hello-hello/commits/main/packages/markwiemer.com). You're more than welcome to create GitHub issues as well.
