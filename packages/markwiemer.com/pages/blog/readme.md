# Blog

- Articles are written in Markdown + HTML
- Template is written in HTML, putting article content in a div
- Build output is formatted for inspection, but not committed, as it's procedurally generated

## Hardlinks

Some Markdown files here are hardlinked to my Obsidian vault for ergonomic editing:

```sh
ln /path/to/original /path/to/hardlink
```

For example:

```sh
ln "/home/markw/my-stuff/obsidian/News/2026-01-07 Killing of Renee Good.md" "./2026-01-07 killing-renee-good.md"
```
