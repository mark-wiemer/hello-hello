# 2026-01-07 Killing of Renée Good

These are early stage personal notes, highly subject to change. It's also unclear to me whether her legal name includes the diacritic (Renee vs Renée), but it seems [she preferred to use the diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Killing_of_Renee_Good#Requested_move_10_January_2026).

### General

#### Illegal orders

- [5 USC 3331: Oath of office](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:3331%20edition:prelim)>)
    - An individual, except the President, elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services, shall take the following oath: “I, AB, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.” This section does not affect other oaths required by law.

#### Rights of illegal immigrants

RE the term "illegal immigrant": I use the term most likely to be used by people that disagree with me. This focuses the issue on rights, not words. For now, I tolerate the use of this term and may write a blog post explaining my thoughts later.

- United States Constitution
    - Fifth Amendment: "No person shall be… deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."
    - Fourteenth Amendment: "Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person… the equal protection of the laws."
    - No mention of immigration status
- [1886-05-10 - Yick Wo v. Hopkins - Supreme Court via Justia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/)
    - Non-citizens in the jurisdiction of the United States have equal protection rights
    - > These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.
    - > It is accordingly enacted by § 1977 of the Revised Statutes, that
      >
      > "all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other."

    - > we are constrained to conclude that they do not mean to leave room for the play and action of purely personal and arbitrary power
    - > while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts
    - > the law is the definition and limitation of power

#### Use of force

- [1791-12-15 - Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution - Library of Congress](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/)
    - > The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

- [2014-05-27 - Plumhoff v. Rickard - Supreme Court via Justia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/765/)
    - > the police officers in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they used deadly force to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase
    - > Rickard’s outrageously reckless driving—which lasted more than five minutes, exceeded 100 miles per hour, and included the passing of more than two dozen other motorists—posed a grave public safety risk
    - > if officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended
- [2025-05-15 - Barnes v. Felix - Supreme Court via Justia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/605/23-1239/)
    - To assess whether an officer acted reasonably in using force under the Fourth Amendment, a court must consider all the relevant circumstances, including facts and events leading up to the climactic moment.
    - > "totality of the circumstances" inquiry has no time limit
    - > Prior events may show why a reasonable officer would perceive otherwise ambiguous conduct as threatening

    - fleeing felon rule overturned in 1985 Tennessee v. Garner
        - > The [Supreme] Court concluded that the officer’s use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a non-violent felon [Edward Garner] was unconstitutional, writing, “It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.”
    - > In place of the fleeing felon rule, the Court adopted the standard that has remained in place for the last forty years: The Fourth Amendment allows officers to use deadly force, meaning force that is substantially likely to cause serious physical harm or death, in response to what is reasonably perceived as an imminent threat of serious physical harm or death.
    - > state authorities can charge, and have charged, federal agents for alleged violations of state law
    - > whether it was reasonable to perceive Ms. Good’s actions as presenting an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm
        - > cannot be answered by merely reviewing the various videos
        - > the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene - Supreme Court, 1989 Graham v Connor et al
    - ability, opportunity, and intention
    - why was the officer in front of the vehicle?
        - part of the totality of circumstances

    - could he have stepped out of the way instead of shooting?
        - shooting doesn't help
            - > broadly recognized across police agencies and organizations
                - 2020-07 National Consensus Policy and Discussion Paper on Use of Force
                    - > “Firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle” when the vehicle is the only weapon involved unless other means of addressing the threat presented by the vehicle, such as moving out of the way, “have been exhausted (or are not present or practical).”
        - > the [Department of Homeland Security Use of Force policy](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf) discourages officers from shooting at moving vehicles
            - 2023-02-06, Section V: Warning Shots and Disabling Fire
                - > prohibited from discharging firearms solely ... [t]o disable moving vehicles
                - Only exceptions: warning shots and disabling fire: "may discharge firearms to disable moving vehicles, vessels, and other conveyances, and such disabling fire is classified as less-lethal force"

	- "the goal ... is to establish dominance over the narrative as quickly and as forcefully as possible"
	- "fundamentally disrespectful to the intelligence and agency of the American people"
	- "do you think they would be lying about this if they didn't think the shooting deserved more justification than the facts gave us?"
	- "they'd stick to the truth if they thought the truth was enough"
	- "they're showing by their actions that they also don't believe the shooting was justified, otherwise they wouldn't be lying"
