# Hello POSIX

Short for Portable Operating System Interface (the X apparently has no meaning),
POSIX is a set of standards for tools to work across operating systems,
like how [Bash](../bash/readme.md) works nearly the same in Windows and Linux distributions.

- [POSIX - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
- [Shell and Utilities section of POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/contents.html): Bash aims to be compliant with this section, but also has a special `--posix` option to more closely align. See [Bash](../bash/readme.md) for more details.
