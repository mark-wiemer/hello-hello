# Hello GitHub Codespaces (GHCS)

[GitHub Codespaces docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)

> You can connect to your codespaces from your browser, from Visual Studio Code, or by using GitHub CLI. - [What are Codespaces?](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/about-codespaces/what-are-codespaces#introduction)

For now, these docs assume connecting from the browser. When connecting via github.com, GitHub opens a new tab at \*.github.dev, where the subdomain is auto-generated by GitHub when you create your codespace. However, the editor is VS Code in-browser, canonically hosted at vscode.dev. See also [Hello Visual Studio Code](../../vscode/readme.md).

> All GitHub personal accounts include a quota of free compute time and storage for GitHub Codespaces. Any usage beyond the included amounts is billed to the personal account. - [GitHub Codespaces billing](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces#free-and-billed-use-by-personal-accounts)

Phew!
