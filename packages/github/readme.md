# Hello GitHub

[GitHub docs homepage](https://docs.github.com/en)

Interesting subpages:

- [GitHub Apps docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps): OK I had never heard of this one
- [GitHub CLI docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli) has a great quickstart

## Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is the service that runs workflows.
Workflows are defined in workflow files.
Workflow files must be in `/.github/workflows`, no subfolders allowed.

- [stale.yml](/.github/workflows/stale.yml) handles stale issues and PRs. Ref [workflow run](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/hello-hello/actions/runs/19620829424)
