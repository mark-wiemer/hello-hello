# Hello Unified

The [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) collective is a group of software maintainers focused on content processing. They maintain [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/community/about/#who-governs-mdx) and other content processing toolchains. All of these packages used by this project are published by the unified collective. Notable transitive dependencies are also listed:

- @types/mdast
- remark
- remark-parse
- remark-stringify
- to-vfile
- unified
- unist
- unist-util-visit
- vfile

The `tsx` package is separate from the unified collective, see [the typescript project](../typescript/readme.md) for details.
