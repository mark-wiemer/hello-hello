# Hello Modrinth

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) is an open-source client for launching Minecraft and managing mods, shaders, resource packs, and data packs.

The `code` folder is a submodule cloning the client itself.

On Linux, there are [longstanding known issues with running Modrinth](https://github.com/modrinth/code/issues/3057). There are some workarounds that exist if your CPU has an integrated graphics card, but mine doesn't. So I plan to build an old version of the code and run that. Wish me luck!
